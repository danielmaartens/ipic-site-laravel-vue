            <h2>Ipic Asset Management</h2>

            <p>We manage the assets of Ipic Properties. We handle all aspects of management including sourcing, funding, managing, maintaining, leasing, marketing and refinancing.</p>
            <p>We separate the asset management function and operational management function as follows;</p>
        <p><b>Asset management</b> deals with acquisition strategy, treasury, sourcing and funding of deals. The Managing Director, Financial Director and Portfolio Manager are responsible for these functions.</p>
        <p><b>Operational management</b> deals with leasing, rental collection, facilities management, marketing, long-term maintenance and tenant relationships. Ipic Property Management is responsible for these functions.</p>
        <p>As of September 2019 we manage 191 tenants occupying approximately 61 581.40 mÂ² of Gross Lettable Area (GLA) in nine buildings in the Western Cape. All centres are within one and a half hours drive from our operational office in Durbanville. The properties are located from Claremont in the southern suburbs and stretches from Hermanus in the east to Vredenburg in the west including properties in Stellenbosch, Somerset West and the northern suburbs of Cape Town (Aurora, Kenridge, Sonstraal Heights and Soneike in Kuils River).
        </p>
        <p>The operational office employs seven administrative and facility staff directly. Indirectly they employ 39 security guards and 25 cleaning staff.</p>
        <p>We are continually looking for experienced and motivated staff to work with us in this dynamic environment. We also provide apprenticeships for young emerging adults.
